It includes a clickable deck that lets you draw cards until they run out. The cards zoom in when you move the mouse over them. They can also be dragged freely inside the window, and when dropped they will stay on top of the other cards.

If you drop a card inside the paper bin it will be returned at the bottom of the deck, ready to be drawn again.

The "New game" button returns all the cards to the deck and shuffles them again.
