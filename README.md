It includes a clickable deck that lets you draw cards until they run out. The cards zoom in when you move the mouse over them, and can be dragged freely inside the window.

If you drop a card inside the paper bin, it will be returned at the bottom of the deck ready to be drawn again.

The "New game" button returns all the cards to the deck and shuffles them again.
